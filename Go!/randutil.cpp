/*

    Randutil is meant for creating very accurate pseudo random numbers.  The
	problem with the typical methods is that they are either approximations
	or limited to small ranges.  The functions given below use double 
	precision floating point for all internal calculations without introducing
	any runaway accuracy problems.  Hence all output should considered to be
	accurate within a few ulps (you can assume a handful of round off errors.)

	Where size_t is used, only values which are round trip convertable through
	a double precision floating point number are valid.  On most systems this
	is either 32 or 53 bits worth.


		int randbiased (double x);

		Returns 1 with a probability of x otherwise a 0.  It is assumed that
		x is between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive, otherwise x will behave as if
		clamped to that range.


		size_t randslot (const double slots[n-1], size_t n);

		Picks an index from 0 to n-1 inclusive, where the array slots[] is
		at least n-1 elements, and each entry must be a monotonically non-
		decreasing sequence of probabilities.  If the slots array does not
		follow the conditions required, this function may be very slow and
		will output meaningless results.


		size_t randrange (size_t n);

		Picks a value from 0 to n-1 inclusive with equal expected 
		likelihood.
		
		This is commonly implemented as (PRNG_FUNCTION() % n) which is 
		inescapably inaccurate if n does not divide evenly into
		(1+PRNG_MAXIMUM) let alone if n is larger than 1+PRNG_MAXIMUM.

		TODO: switch to iterated method if n is too large for double 
		precision accuracy.


		double drand (void);

		Picks a uniformly value between 0.0 and 1.0 .


		unsigned int randreseed (void);

		Reseed the random number generator and return the seed used.

		TODO: Generalize by allowing for other sources of entropy via callbacks
		and try to comply with the Fortuna mechanism.
